# XARRY-applications
Use Xarray to read and analyze geophysical data sets.
This simple routine can be used to manipulate netcdf sea surface height dataset using xarry
the data set has to be downloded to a local machine first. I used the features of xarry to change the longitude levels
and also to select the data set in a region of interest.
